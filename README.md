## Currency Converter

A simple React app that uses the [exchange rates API](https://exchangeratesapi.io/) to get the latest or historical currency exchange rates for selected currencies, and converts the entered amount from one currency to another. I built this tool to practice and demonstrate my ReactJS skills.
The API only supports historical rates since 1999.
