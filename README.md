## Currency Converter.

A simple React app that uses the [exchange rates API](https://exchangeratesapi.io/) to get the latest or historical currency exchange rates for selected currencies, and converts the entered amount from one currency to another. I built this tool to practice and demonstrate my ReactJS skills.
The API only supports historical rates since 1999.

React libraries used:

- [chakra ui](https://next.chakra-ui.com/docs/getting-started)
- [React Reel](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-reel) for the reel effect of temperature
